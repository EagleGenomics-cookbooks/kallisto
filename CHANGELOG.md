kallisto/ CHANGELOG
===================

This file is used to list changes made in each version of the kallisto cookbook.

1.0.4
-----
- [Daniel Barrell] - Added tests for building an index and running quantification.

1.0.3
-----
- [Daniel Barrell] - Moved binary install to default and added code to dependencies and source for installing from source. However, kallisto uses a cmd line arg that requires a newer gcc version than the one that ships with cent-os 6.6 so we have stuck to the default binary install for now. Added more tests.

1.0.2
-----
- [Daniel Barrell] - Install to /usr/local. Force symbolic link.

1.0.1
-----
- [Daniel Barrell] - Updated to kallisto 0.42.4

1.0.0
-----
- [Daniel Barrell] - Initial release of kallisto cookbook
